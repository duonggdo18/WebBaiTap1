        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>

        <h2>Aomame</h2>
        <h2>Don,t let appearances fool you</h2>
        <p>The taxi’s radio was tuned to a classical FM broadcast. Janacek’s Sinfonietta—probably not the ideal music to hear in <br>
             a taxi caught in traffic. The middle-aged driver didn’t seem to be listening very closely, either. With his mouth <br>
             clamped shut, he stared straight ahead at the endless line of cars stretching out on the elevated expressway, like a <br>
             veteran fisherman standing in the bow of his boat, reading the ominous confluence of two currents. Aomame settled into <br>
             the broad back seat, closed her eyes, and listened to the music. <br>
            <br>
            How many people could recognize Janacek’s Sinfonietta after hearing just the first few bars? Probably somewhere between <br>
            “very few” and “almost none.” But for some reason, Aomame was one of the few who could. <br>
            <br>
            Janacek composed his little symphony in 1926. He originally wrote the opening as a fanfare for a gymnastics festival. <br>
            Aomame imagined 1926 Czechoslovakia: The First World War had ended, and the country was freed from the long rule of <br>
            the Hapsburg Dynasty. As they enjoyed the peaceful respite visiting central Europe, people drank Pilsner beer in cafs <br>
            and manufactured handsome light machine guns. Two years earlier, in utter obscurity, Franz Kafka had left the world <br>
             behind. Soon Hitler would come out of nowhere and gobble up this beautiful little country in the blink of an eye, but <br>
             at the time no one knew what hardships lay in store for them. This may be the most important proposition revealed by <br>
             history: “At the time, no one knew what was coming.” Listening to Jancek’s music, Aomame imagined the carefree winds <br>
             sweeping across the plains of Bohemia and thought about the vicissitudes of history. <br>
